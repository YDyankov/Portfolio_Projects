# Portfolio_Projects
This is the home to the different projects that are going to represent my knowledge and skills in the data analytics field. 
I'll slowly build this page to showcase my work in whole.

A lot of these projects are guided. I've had to add a number of corections to them, as their databases have been updated multiple times throughout the years.
They are a good time capsule of what I could do at the time they were built and I hope to have the time to keep back to them and making them more and more complicated. 

Enjoy!
